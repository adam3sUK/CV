## Adam Harbisher

I am formerly a Web Designer with 8 years experience who has recently shifted into the world of development. I have worked on over 100 responsive web sites predominantly in the financial sector.
I am excited to move into development, with the goal to work on more ambitious and interactive websites/applications than I have previously.

## Work Experience

**AccSYS Digital Ltd** (September 2013 to September 2021)  
_Web Designer_

- Worked for 8 years building and designing websites for Accountants in the UK.
- Became very proficient in HTML and CSS (mainly in .less), as well as experienced in jQuery.
- Gained experience in project planning, taking a website from the initial order through to: Design Brief, Wireframe, Preview, Deployment and Live Support.
- Gained experience in liaisoning with clients: Discussing with them aspects of their websites, negotiating new feature implementations, and generally covering the 'why' on the work that we did.
- Prioritisation of workflow and time management, using a ticketing system to give certain jobs greater importance, as well as managing delegation when needed.

**Subway** (Summer 2011 to September 2013)  
_Team Leader_

- Working in a fast paced, agile enviroment.
- Working both within a team and solo enviroment.
- Using clear communication with both other members of the team, as well as the general public.
- Leadership, how to delegate work between members of the team.

## Skills

Compartmentalising: An example of this happened on the Coding Forum project mentioned above. I wanted to add a user-to-user direct messaging system, something I had not previously done. By compartmentalising how the feature would work, such as the models and database - I realised it would not be possible to have two user_id columns in a single table (sender, recipient). I was able to work out by focusing on this small part of the task, that one of the users would need a child model belonging to them, this allowed me to come up with the idea of giving every user an 'inbox' model, that would work as the id for the recipient user.

Leadership/Teamwork: At my previous job, I had a new co-worker who'd added some jQuery to a client's website which hadn't worked as intended, leading to an upset client. I took over the assigned ticket, found a solution and quickly implemented the solution to solve the client's issue. I then spoke to the co-worker afterwards and explained how we can test features using our preview enviroment for websites, as well as using scoping to see desired outputs throughout the code.

Initiative/adaptability: I believe one of my best qualities is my initiative, as I don't like being idle in a work/learning environment. I've took on solo projects in my spare time to keep me busy and my skillset sharp. I throughout the Makers course, whenever I had a pairing partner that couldn't make it, seeked out others that I could either pair with, or work as a trio with. This has shone through in my previous jobs: At Accsys I was the only member of the design/support team who was not directly assigned to one of the two client bases, likewise at Subway, I was the only member of staff not directly assigned to a single store.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (October 2021 to January 2022)
Makers are a coding bootcamp designed to help people transition from their previous work to being hirable junior developers. At the bootcamp I learnt to:

- Use pair-programming to tackle problems. As a pair I'd: communicate often, switch between navigator/driver, share code through Github.
- Grou projects: Working in a group, using Agile sprint methods: Morning standups, Branching and Pull requests via Github, Retrospectives.
- Learning various coding priciples such as CRUD, TDD, OOP and more through Ruby.
- Learning to unit and feature test through RSpec.
- Other languages used through the course include: Javascript (React, Express.js, Node), Python (Django, Django REST).
